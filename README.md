P.S JigZz is a faggot, and participates in credit card/PayPal fraud. Also his "crack" was of an old version. This is the real deal.
Look at this fake video with a fake download https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6qGdLm9opQ - he infects people with cracked NanoCore crypted with CyberSeal and steals their card/PayPal info. Feel free to tip the FBI off on this kid. Have a nice day!
